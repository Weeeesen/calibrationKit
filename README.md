### Notes
- Clone git repo into desired folder
- Open calibrationKit.ipj (project) file
- Proceed to open desired ipt (part) or iam (assembly) files
- *Without opening project file, Inventor will constantly open dialog box to notify that file is not in the same project (because every user will have different location for their inventor project, commonly in C:/Users/<user>/Documents/Inventor/ or some sort)
